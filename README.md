# Fair Classification w/o Sensitive Attribute Access -- GreenwichAI 7
This repo contains the code related to the 7th Greenwich AI Meetup.    
It is modified from its original form to run on Mac OS. I would highly recommend looking at [the original source](https://github.com/akshajkumarv/fairness_without_demographics) for training data, README, etc.      
You may find the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01385).
